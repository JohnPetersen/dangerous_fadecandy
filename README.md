Display Modes
-------------
* Mouse controlled
* Bouncing ball
* Follower and Orbital linked-motion types


TODO
-----
* Fix the speed strategy, the images don't appear to slow down at the same rate.
* Add more strategies
 * ColorCycle - color strategy that cycles through a list of colors.
* Update strategies to take constructor parameters for time intervals and other values to help differentiate the look of each image.
* Create a state input class for keyboard control so the Danger Shield is not required
